was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here
    The more knowledge we have the better we get. I think for a programmer, it's quite
    helpful to know about the history of the program he is working in, it helps in undes-
    tanding the changes that have been made. It also makes it easier to make new changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here
    Manually choosing to create commit in small interval of time but not too small such 
    that comparing two adjacent commits become a waste of time, creating commit with  
    significant changes saves time but manually creating commit has of drawback that if 
    the user forgets to commit then it will become difficult to find why the changes were 
    made. 
    
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
    Version controls like git are specially made for programmers, it is important for pro-
    -grammers to save multiple files in one commit as generally a change in one file cause
    change in other files, while other's like Google Docs are not specifically for progra-
    -mers and not generally required by the users to save multiple files when changes have
    been made to one.
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
    To use Git log and Git diff, user must use Git clone to clone the repository then enter
    git log in the command line to use git log and for git diff, user should provide com-
    mit id of the current and the previous commit to use the command. 
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
    Version control allows us to manually create commit which we can do after applying any 
    changes without worrying much about whether it can create a bug or not.
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fill in your answer here
    I can use git to make new projects while being confident to make changes that could 
    break something and exploring new features that can be add to the program.
